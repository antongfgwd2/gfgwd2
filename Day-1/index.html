      French is an
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_language"
        >official language</a
      >
      in 26 countries, as well as one of the most geographically widespread
      languages in the world, with speakers in about 50 countries.

      <sup
        ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_language">[4]</a></sup
      >

      Most of these countries are members of the
      <em> Organisation internationale de la Francophonie (OIF)</em>, the
      community of 54 member states which share the use or teaching of French.
      It is estimated to have about 310 million speakers, of which about 74
      million are native speakers;[5] it is spoken as a first language (in
      descending order of the number of speakers) in France, Canada (Quebec),
      <b>Belgium (Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region)</b>, western
      Switzerland (Romandy region), parts of Luxembourg, and
      <strong> Monaco</strong>.[6] Meanwhile in Francophone Africa it is spoken
      mainly as a second language or lingua franca, though it has also become a
      native language in a small number of urban areas; in some North African
      countries like Algeria, despite not having official status, it is also a
      first language among some upper classes of the population alongside the
      indigenous ones, but only a second one among the general population.[7]
